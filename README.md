## **🛠️ About the Project**  

This is a **character creator and character sheet tracker** for a homebrew tabletop RPG set in a world I call **Bots and Botany**. It includes:  

✅ **A fully functional character creator**  
✅ **Species descriptions & game rules**  
✅ **A simple account system** (just a username at this point—not intended for security, just to associate characters with a user)  
✅ **Character management features**  

🛑 **⚠️ Disclaimer:** User accounts are only to link you to your characters. **Think of this more as a proof of concept.** **Data is stored in a `json-server`, so nothing is private.**

- **React-Bootstrap** (UI components)  
- **Cloudinary** (for image uploads)
