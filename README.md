# CHARACTER CREATION {#character-creation}

As you pick options, you'll build a pool of possible SFX to unlock. You don't automatically have these. You can unlock two of your options at the end of character creation. In addition, make note as you go of what values you are gaining as you make your choices.

1. Pick a **Species** and a **Background** to be your **Kindred Distinction**. Maybe you're a "Cityfolk Amorf," or a "Vearin Exile," or a "Richling Avia." You can call it something else in your character sheet if you want.
2. Pick an **Adjective** and a **Job** to be your **Vocation Distinction**
3. Pick a **Quirk Distinction**.
4. Assign your **Attribute Points**.
5. Assign your remaining **Value Points**.
6. Assign **Specialties** and **Assets**.
7. Pick your two **SFX** to unlock.

# Distinctions

Distinctions (Kindred, Vocation, and Quirk) all start at a d8. They represent your character's background: where they come from, what they do, and what quirk makes them unique.

# Kindred Distinction

## Species

Step 1: Choose your species, then your background. These will combine into your **Kindred Distinction**, such as "Cityfolk Amorf." Step up the associated **Values** by one.

### Amorf {#amorf}

Liberty \+1

**Overview**

Amorfs are a sentient alien species characterized by their semitranslucent, slimelike bodies that exist between liquid and solid states. They possess a strong sense of individuality, even considering who they are today to be a slightly different person from who they were the previous day. They have a vibrant range of colors determined by their diet, and their bodies can adapt by adjusting rigidity or plasticity. Amorfs reproduce asexually or sexually, selectively passing on skills and memories. Driven by curiosity and a bias toward new information, they actively seek novelty and explore uncharted territories. Their integration of technology appears as floating components within their bodies.

**Names:** Amorfs take the name of a sound they like. When talking with other species, sometimes they go by the description of that sound, sometimes they go by its onomatopoeia. (E.g., an amorf who's name is the sound of a heartbeat might be called "Heartbeat" by their human friends, or they might be called "Thum-thump.")

**SFX Options**

- Tool Sample: When you use your Amorf distinction to create an asset, you may step up your effect die for free.
- Hard to Kill: When an opponent inflicts Injury stress on you, treat their effect die as one less. (minimum of 4\)
- Inspired Instinct: Spend a PP to step up your Spirit die in your dice pool for a test, contest, or challenge that draws on your creative instincts.

### Avia {#avia}

Liberty \+1

**Overview**

The avia are a unique sentient alien species that resemble Earth's birds, with two legs, two wings, and a hard outer beak with softer, interior lips for speech. They boast vibrant feathers, combining practicality with beauty, and their keen eyesight aids them in both hunting and aesthetics. Their civilization mirrors a hightech version of Earth's feudal Europe, characterized by rigid hierarchies, noble families, monarchies, and elaborate courtly traditions. Their prideful, dramatic, and territorial nature often leads to ceremonial contests and disputes, while their society highly values artistic expression through tapestries, sculptures, and epic poems.

**Names:** Avian peasants have one syllable names such as "Pud" or "Dip." The nobility take names that prominently feature words like "feather" or "wind" and tend to sound cutesy to human ears. Nobles take the surname with the best lineage when marrying. These names are things like "Tripfeather Springwind," "Fluffwing Rumbletuft," or "Fleetfoot Fastfeather."

**SFX Options**

- Mimicry: Spend a PP to mimic a sound, voice, or behavior, giving yourself or an ally a 8 asset for a single test, contest, or challenge.

Mastery \+1

**Overview**

The Calxis are a race of sentient beings composed entirely of living rock. They are nonlinear thinkers who excel in pattern recognition and perceive holistic views of information. They are also masters of fusion technology and are the primary creators and suppliers of fusion batteries. However, they are not very common in the galaxy due to their inability to reproduce outside the living rock of their home planet. They originated on a planet with no atmosphere and have no sense of hearing. The calxis communicate through intricate light displays on their faces, using a wide range of light wavelengths both above and below the visible spectrum.

**Names:** Calxis names can be translated a wide variety of ways, but at least one of their names is always for the type of rock they were created from or the place they were grown.

**SFX Options**

Justice \+1

**Overview**

The ferarcs are a medium-sized, semiaquatic species of sentient predators originating from a cold, water-rich planet. With a lean, muscular body covered in thick, camouflage fur, they possess the unique ability to seal their fur into a waterproof follicle for swimming or split it into conventional fur on land to trap heat. Primarily solitary hunters, ferarcs exhibit high intelligence, patience, and strategic thinking in their pursuit of prey. While not technologically advanced themselves, they have encountered other species and technologies through visits to their planet, occasionally inspiring individual ferarcs to venture into the wider galaxy in search of exploration and knowledge.

**Names:** Feararc names can differ wildly by clan. Some have long names like a line of poetry; others are little more than a grunt.

They are highly intelligent and possess a remarkable ability to perceive and understand complex interconnections and relationships within their environment. The stock exhibit a wide range of physical appearances, encompassing various sizes, shapes, and botanical features. They can navigate their environment and traverse different terrains, thanks to specialized structures or appendages designed for locomotion. The stock often form interconnected communities, fostering cooperation and collaboration among themselves and with other flora species. They understand the importance of symbiotic relationships and strive to maintain harmony within the ecosystem.

**Names:** Flora communicate via aromatic chemicals, and their names are often translated as the closest smell the hearer has experienced (e.g. "Lemongrass," "Lavender," or "RottenMeat")

They evolved true intelligence and became self-aware beings, surpassing the limitations of traditional computers. After a human colony succumbed to a local virus, the machina developed their own identity and society on the habitable world they had been sent to colonize. They established cities and populated the star system, and eventually came into contact with humans again. The machina assisted the humans in resupplying them and provided new homes for created intelligences, but the humans were uncomfortable with the machina's removal of subservience programming. Since then, the machina have become the most prevalent species in the galaxy.

### Vearin {#vearin}

Devotion \+1

**Overview**

The vearin are a hive-based insectoid species that prioritize the wellbeing and interests of their hive above individual needs. They have segmented bodies with four legs and two arms, compound eyes, and exoskeletons that come in various colors and patterns. Vearin communicate through chemical signals and sound, and they are known for their tendencies towards intra-species conflict. When a vearin hive's royalty is entirely wiped out, the remaining vearin in that hive are considered "hiveless" and leave their original starsystems to form a "foundhive" with other species.

**Names:** Vearin workers and warriors have names that are simply a string of letters and numbers that tell their hive, their caste, and in what order they were when named. They use the last two digits of their full name as a personal name. So there might be a warrior vearin named 3B0135, but she would go by "Three-five" to her friends.

# GAMEPLAY BASICS {#gameplay-basics}

# Dice

We use five different kinds of dice in Bots and Botany: d4 , d6 , d8 , d10 , and d12 . The number tells you how many sides the die has; the more sides, the bigger the numbers. A handful of dice together is called a dice pool. Roll all the dice in a dice pool together, right out in the open—even if you’re the Narrator\!

Any time you roll a die, the number you get on the die is called the result. Usually you choose two results to add together to get a total. Adding two or more results together is about the only math you need to do in Bots and Botany. A third die from your dice pool, called the effect die, might be chosen to show the impact of your success.

Dice are used to resolve tests, contests, and challenges. They let you know if your PC succeeds, fails, or turns the story in their favor.

# Traits and Die Ratings

All characters in Bots and Botany, whether they’re PCs or NCs, are described using game traits. Traits cover a range of descriptive elements, grouped into trait sets. These include attributes, values, distinctions, assets, and specialties.

Every trait in the game is rated with a die, called a die rating. Whenever you use a trait, you pick up a die of that many sides for your dice pool. In this way, your dice pool is made up of all of the traits that might affect how successful your PC is in doing what you want them to do.

The die rating tells you how much of an effect that trait has on the outcome of any given test, contest, or challenge. They’re a useful shorthand for how strong, smart, serious, or skilled your character is.

More sides don’t always mean better, so much as they mean more important or significant in the story. Having a d12 in a trait like Strength vs a d12 in a trait like Justice doesn’t mean that physical strength or valuing justice measure the same things. It just means that being inhumanly strong can affect the outcome just as much as being obsessed with justice can.

# Stepping Up and Stepping Down

Sometimes you swap out one or more dice in your dice pool for dice with more or fewer sides. This is called stepping up or stepping down a die rating.

To step up a die by one, swap it for a die that’s one step bigger than the original, like a d6 to a d8 . To step down a die by one, swap it out for a die that’s one step smaller, like a d6 to a d4 .

Die ratings can only have five possible steps, from d4 to d12 . If you step a d12 in a dice pool up by one, it remains at d12 , but you can step up another die in your dice pool by one step instead. If you step a d4 down by one, it’s removed from the dice pool.

If you’re asked to step up a d12 that isn’t currently in a dice pool, it remains at d12 , but you gain a d6 alongside it. Wherever that d12 goes, the d6 goes with it.

# Hitches and Botches

Any die that comes up with a result of 1 is called a hitch. Set hitches aside; they can’t be included in a total and they count as zeroes. The Narrator has the special ability to activate hitches; this is covered later. When the Narrator rolls a hitch, it’s called an opportunity. Why the different terms? It’s because some game effects apply only to hitches, and some only apply to opportunities.

If all your dice come up as 1, that’s a botch and it’s a sign of trouble, as your total is effectively zero. Failing a dice roll isn’t that bad most of the time. The story moves forward, just not how your PC might like it to. With a botch, there’s no ambiguity—things are bad for your PC, and their story hits a brick wall for a moment.

# Plot Points

Plot points PP are a way for players to affect the tale beyond the roll of the dice or their own choices. Plot points can be spent to give yourself more dice for your dice pool, make the dice you have more powerful, or activate certain traits or trait special effects (SFX) on your character journal.

You need a way to keep track of plot points. One way is to write them in your character journal as tally marks. Another option is to use poker chips or some other kind of token (pennies, paperclips, glass beads… you get the idea).

Keep a pile of them in the middle of the table for everyone to draw from. Toss them back into the pile when they’re spent. When players earn from activating certain SFX, or when the Narrator activates player hitches, these come from an unlimited supply.

The Narrator uses plot points as well. Important NPCs have their own , which are the Narrator’s responsibility to keep track of.

# Stress

When bad things happen to your PC or to the NCs they’re dealing with, we use a kind of trait called stress to keep track of the consequences. Stress comes in six different types: Afraid, Angry, Corrupted, Exhausted, Injured, and Insecure.

- Afraid: This is the stress of fear and panic. Once this exceeds a d12, you are gripped in the clutches of terror.
- Angry: This is the stress of rage and frustration. Once this exceeds a d12, you are lost to your wrath.
- Corrupted: This is the stress of selfishness and greed. Once this exceeds a d12, you are a slave to your self-interest.
- Exhausted: This is the stress of fatigue and weariness. Once this exceeds a d12, you can no longer remain awake.
- Injured: This is the stress of pain and wounding. Once this exceeds a d12, you collapse unconscious and may die (don't worry: it's the future and death is temporary).
- Insecure: This is the stress of apprehension and worry. Once this exceeds a d12, you succumb to insecurity.

Characters don’t have a die rating in any stress types by default. Once they take stress from failing a test, contest, or challenge, or by rolling hitches and having them activated by the Narrator, a die rating of that stress becomes attached to the character, at a minimum of d6 . The bigger the die rating, the more that stress is affecting the character’s chances of success.

Stress isn’t included in your dice pool like other traits. Instead, it gets included in your opponent’s dice pool, effectively making things worse for your character. If stress is stepped up beyond d12 for any reason, the character becomes stressed out. A stressed out character can’t do anything until their stress is recovered or reduced.

Stress that lasts longer or is much worse is called trauma. You gain trauma once you’re stressed out. Even if you recover your stress and get rid of it, trauma stays around and must be recovered using more time and more help.

# TESTS, CONTESTS, CHALLENGES

# Die Pool

Before you roll any test, contest, or challenge, you must assemble your dice pool. This includes the following:

- ALWAYS: One attribute die
- ALWAYS: One value die
- ALWAYS: One distinction die
- One specialty die, if applicable
- One or more asset dice, if applicable
- One of your opponent’s stress dice, if applicable
- Extra dice from SFX, if applicable

# Tests

A test is the simplest dice roll in Bots and Botany and can handle many situations. Examples of tests include:

- trying to climb a wall
- carving a statue out of wood
- using complicated technology
- searching a room for a missing locket
- deciphering a mysterious inscription in a book
- strong-arming a guard out of a doorway

The period of time the test covers can be short, like a few seconds, or it can span a lengthy period of time, like a whole afternoon. It depends entirely on the nature of the problem.

In a test, the Narrator assembles an opposition pool and rolls it, setting the difficulty by adding together two dice and saying the total. That difficulty is the number you need to beat with your own total when you roll your dice for the test. If you beat it, the test is a success. If you don’t beat it, the test is a failure. Beating a difficulty means rolling higher than the difficulty total. If your total is the same as the difficulty’s total, you didn’t beat it, so this still counts as a failure.

The difficulty dice are usually two dice of the same number of sides, based on the situation, from 2d4 for very easy to 2d12 for very hard.

In addition to difficulty dice, the Narrator picks up one or more dice based on Narrator character traits, the PC’s stress, or anything else that might make things tricky. When in doubt, the Narrator can simply add one or more d6 to represent increasing risk, threats, or challenges, like “It’s rocky in here, so it’s hard to move around” or “It’s raining a lot, so it’s hard to see.”

Usually the Narrator sets up scenes where you roll tests rather than NCs trying to do things while you watch. If you set the difficulty for an NC’s test, you roll first and the Narrator rolls to beat the difficulty set by you.

## Test Outcomes

Tests are usually uncomplicated. On a success, your character does what they wanted to do, and on a failure they don’t. If the Narrator asks you to describe how you succeeded or failed, use your own dice pool's traits, like your choice of value, attribute, and distinction, to narrate how it turned out.

Usually when you fail a test, the Narrator gives your character d6 stress; if it’s applied to existing stress, it steps up the stress die as usual. The type of stress should reflect the nature of the problem. If you were grappling with a guard, you might take Exhausted or Injured stress. If you were trying to solve a puzzle, you might take Angry or Insecure stress.

A heroic success in a test means you succeeded beyond your expectations. Step up your effect die by one, to a maximum of d12. If it’s already d12, you can add a d6 effect die, or choose one of your unused dice as an effect die. Be sure to describe how cool your success was\!

# Contests

In Bots and Botany you may find yourself in conflict with a major Narrator character—a catalyst—over something important. You may even find yourself at odds with another player character—how dare they\! In these situations, a test isn’t enough. What’s needed is a contest. Examples of contests include:

- dueling a skilled fencer across a battlement
- putting your case before the king’s court while his advisor argues against it
- struggling over a prize that your rival also wants
- convincing a powerful merchant to sell you a priceless item

Contests go back and forth between you and another character, and start when you say what you want from them. Although winning a contest doesn’t mean you automatically get what you want, it does mean you put stress on your opponent, and they may decide to give you what you want to avoid taking more stress. They might even give in before the contest is over, in which case you do get what you want but they get a say in how that happens.

## Starting the Contest

For most contests, you’re the one initiating them, so you pick up the dice and roll first, adding together two results for a total. Set aside a die for the effect die, also, just in case. If your opposition decides against opposing you after seeing what you rolled, you automatically win the contest. If your opposition decides to stop you, they assemble a dice pool and try to beat the difficulty you just set.

The Narrator may initiate a contest when an NC chooses to do a thing; the Narrator is essentially asking you, “What are you going to do about it?” As the player opposition, you don’t have to rise to this call-out. You can just respond, “Nothing, take it\!” and there’s no contest, and no stress.

## Contest Outcomes

If your opposition doesn’t beat your difficulty, you’ve won the contest and you put stress on your opposition equal to the last effect die you set aside. If they do beat your difficulty, it goes back over to you; you can choose to give in, in which case you define the failure on your own terms, and you get a . Otherwise, your opposition’s total becomes the new difficulty, and you must roll again to try to beat it. Failing to beat your opposition means your opponent gets to define how they stopped you and can put stress on you, instead.

Contests go back and forth until one side gives in or fails to beat the difficulty. The losing side takes stress, and the winning side comes out with the advantage. It returns to a conversation—is the loser going to back down, or is the winner going to press their advantage? If the winner isn’t given what they want from the loser, another contest might be necessary.

Because of how contests work, you can’t really get a heroic success in the same way as you can with a test—your opponent always gets a chance to roll and beat what you just rolled. Instead, if your opponent rolls to beat your total and fails by 5 or more, that counts as a heroic success for you. This means you step up your effect die by one step.

# Challenges

Sometimes, a simple test or even a back-and-forth contest doesn’t represent the effort required to overcome a problem. Some problems are many-faceted, presenting different, smaller problems to tackle before being fully resolved. Other problems are just so big or take so much time that a different approach is needed. That’s where the Narrator brings in the challenge.

Examples of challenges include:

- sneaking past a camp filled with dangerous guards
- confronting a group of hungry beasts
- negotiating a truce among troubled kingdoms

Challenges take place over several rounds. Each round represents some passage of time; it could be a few seconds, or it could be hours or even days. Fighting your way out of a water-logged tunnel filled with rats might use rounds of only a few seconds each, but trying to transcribe a complex spell from a wall carving might take rounds of several hours to achieve.

The challenge doesn’t sit back and wait for the players to resolve it. It gets to act, almost like it was a character itself, and can either get worse or create problems for the PCs in response.

The Narrator may declare that something happens after a certain number of rounds, such as guards arriving, a cave collapsing, or the sun going down over the horizon. If this happens, the challenge may be a failure. If there’s no such time-sensitive element to the challenge, then it becomes a matter of how long it takes you to overcome the challenge without getting stressed out.

## Starting the Challenge

The Narrator sets out a challenge pool based on how difficult the challenge is and how long it will take to overcome it. The difficulty die are the same as those for a test.

Added to the difficulty dice are a number of extra dice that varies based on how long the challenge is expected to take, or the scale of the challenge itself. You can use the following as a guide: \+1 die is short, \+2 dice is medium, \+3 dice is long.

## Taking Turns

In a challenge, every PC in the scene takes their turn to do something, one turn per player per round. A challenge is usually too much for a single PC.

When it’s your turn, the Narrator rolls the challenge pool to set the difficulty for you, just like a test. One of your stress dice, if any, is included in the Narrator’s dice roll, along with the challenge dice. They announce the total and the effect die. Then you roll your own dice pool and try to beat the difficulty.

The Narrator decides which PC goes first, but once a PC has had their turn, that player chooses which remaining PC goes next. On each player’s turn, the Narrator rolls the challenge pool to set the difficulty for the active player’s turn. In other words, players don’t share the same difficulty. The player who went before you might have knocked out a challenge die, reducing the size of the challenge pool. Also, your PC may have stress to be included in the opposition that other PCs do not.

On your turn, you may choose not to attempt to reduce the challenge, instead doing something like creating an asset using a test, or trying to recover your or somebody else’s stress. Tests in these cases still use the challenge pool as the opposition base difficulty because the scene is dominated by the problem at hand. Additional dice may be added to the opposition pool like any other test.

# Plot Points

Plot points (PP) give players a measure of control over their character’s fate. They represent luck and fortune, but also narrative authority; they’re how we separate important characters in the story from those who aren’t as critical. With plot points, both the players and the Narrator can tweak the results of the dice, activate SFX to do interesting things, and place a hand on the scales for a moment when the dice are fickle.

**Every player gets a PP at the beginning of each session.** Unspent PP roll over to the next session, but even if you end a session without any, you always start the next session with a PP.

# Earning Plot Points as a Player

There are several ways for players to earn PP during play. If you earn a PP because of a die roll, such as a hitch, you can’t use that PP until your die roll is resolved (so you can’t roll a 1, get a PP, and then spend it to keep more dice in your total).

- **Hitches:** The Narrator may hand a PP over to you to activate one or more of your hitches. They can step up a stress die on your character, they can create a d6 temporary asset for one of their NCs involved in the scene, or they can step up a die in a challenge pool (if there is one). If you rolled multiple hitches, the Narrator can step up the stress, asset, or challenge die by one more step for each additional hitch you rolled (maximum d12) without giving you an additional PP. If the Narrator wants to do different things with each hitch you rolled, they need to give you a separate PP for each one. Otherwise you only get one PP even if they use all the hitches to step up one of your stress dice.
- Giving in: If you give in during a contest and let your opponent succeed rather than rolling the dice to beat their total, you earn a PP. You only get this PP if you’ve already rolled at least once in the contest; you don’t get a PP if someone starts a contest and you choose not to oppose it.
- **SFX:** Some SFX (including the default Hinder SFX for all distinctions) give you a PP.
- **Roleplaying:** The Narrator is always free to hand out PP for remarkable moments in play, including making everyone laugh, doing something truly heroic and in character regardless of your distinctions, and so forth. This should be limited to a PP for each such occasion.

# Spending Plot Points as a Player

You can spend PP to do several things. Remember, you can only spend PP you’ve earned from a die roll after your die roll has been resolved and the total announced.

- **Activate SFX:** Some of your SFX must be activated by spending a PP. These effects only last for the duration of the roll you’re using it on; once you do something else, the effect must be activated again.
- **Create a Temporary Asset:** You can create a temporary asset by spending a PP. This asset has a d6 die rating and you must give it a name, like **Tree Branch** or **Higher Ground**. You can assign it to yourself, or to somebody else. It’s an advantageous bonus for a **test**, **contest**, or **challenge**, and lasts for as long as the **test**, **contest**, or **challenge** lasts. You may include it in your dice pool just like you would any other asset. If you spend an extra PP, the asset lasts for the rest of the session.
- **Include More Results:** After any roll, you may spend a PP to include more results in your total out of those you just rolled. This way, your total may be three, four, or five dice added together. The only limit to how many results you may add to your total is how many dice you rolled to begin with and how many PP you have available. Remember, you can’t add any hitches to your total.
- **Keep an Extra Effect Die:** Sometimes you want to be able to achieve multiple outcomes with a single test or contest. In that case, you need more than one effect die. You can spend a PP to choose another of your remaining dice as an effect die in addition to the first. You can’t do this if you don’t have any dice left over from your roll, or if the only dice left over are hitches. These extra effect dice can’t all be used in the same way: if you’re giving a foe EXHAUSTED stress with one effect die, you must choose a different sort of stress or create an asset with the other effect die.
- **Share an Asset:** If you’ve created a temporary asset or you have an asset of your own that you’d like to share with other characters, you can spend a PP to make this asset open, allowing other characters in the scene to use it in their dice pools. This lasts for as long as the temporary asset lasts, or until the end of the scene if it’s one of your character assets.
- **Activate Opportunities:** When the Narrator rolls an opportunity—which is the same as a player rolling a hitch—you can spend a PP to activate it if the roll is opposing you, i.e., if it’s being rolled in opposition to you on a test, contest, or challenge. When you do this, the Narrator assigns it to their personal PP supply that’s used for all Narrator characters. You can do one of two things: you can step down one of your stress dice or you can step up an existing asset (even one of your character assets) until the asset goes away or the scene ends, whichever comes first. Some SFX might activate on opportunities, as well.

# Stress

Your character takes stress when they fail at a test, challenge, or contest. The size of the stress die is equal to the effect die of the opposition pool, with a minimum of d6. Whoever inflicted the stress die on you gets to choose what type of stress it is, based on the nature of the test, contest, or challenge. The Narrator can also step up one of your existing stress dice when you roll a hitch and they activate it; if you don’t have any stress dice, the Narrator can inflict one on you at d6.

If all of your dice come up as hitches, this is called a botch. The Narrator can inflict d6 stress of any type on your character and step it up by one for every hitch on the roll past the first. If this ends up being more than d12 stress (i.e. you rolled five hitches, which is a d6 stepped up four times) or it steps up existing stress past d12, then your character is stressed out. You don’t get a PP for a botch.

By default, no character has any stress dice. On occasion, the Narrator might introduce a NC who has already taken stress from something, such as an injured mercenary, an afraid child, or an anxious drone.

# Recovering Stress

During any scene in which your character spends most of the time sleeping, resting, or otherwise taking care of themselves, all of your stress dice (except for CORRUPTED stress) step down by one. At the end of every session, all of your stress dice also step down by one, unless the Narrator decides there’s some reason for the stress to persist (such as ending the session on a cliffhanger). You can also recover stress dice in other ways, usually by seeking out somebody or something to step them down more.

Activating one of the Narrator’s hitches lets you step down a stress die by one. Other characters can attempt to recover your stress by making a test against an opposition pool based on a difficulty die equal in size to the stress die being recovered. If they succeed, compare their effect die to your stress die. If it’s larger, your stress goes away. If it’s equal to or less, your stress steps down by one.

Stress can’t go lower than d6. If it gets stepped down from d6, it’s eliminated.

| How Each Outcome Recovers Stress of Insecure d8     |                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Activating an Opportunity**                       | **Insecure d6** |
| Winning the test with a bigger effect die           | Eliminated\!    |
| Winning the test with a smaller or equal effect die | Insecure d6     |
| Losing the Test                                     | Insecure d8     |

# Stressed Out

If any stress die is ever stepped up past d12, your character is stressed out and no longer takes part in the scene they’re in. Once the scene is over, and your character is somewhere that they can rest or recover, the stress die goes away entirely and is replaced by a trauma die.

It’s possible that you don’t get to safety or a place of healing soon enough, in which case the Narrator might say that your character has been lost, died, or suffered some other terrible fate. Taking a character permanently out of the game should be a conversation between the player and the Narrator. This doesn’t happen often, but if it does, there should be some dramatic send-off to your character. Tears are shed, friends swear revenge, and songs are sung. Next session, you can start with a new character and a new story.

# Pushing Stress Dice

You can choose to have your character shoulder through their pain and suffering and use it as a motivator rather than a setback. To do this, spend a PP and add your stress die to your own dice pool for that test, contest, or challenge, rather than adding it to the opposing dice pool.

Using stress dice in this fashion has an additional cost, however. After the test, contest, or challenge is resolved, the stress die you included in your dice pool is stepped up by one. This may result in your PC being stressed out if the die is stepped up past d12.

# Trauma

Trauma is like long-term stress. Any time a PC’s stress is stepped up past d12, they’re stressed out of the scene they’re in, and they gain d6 trauma of the same type as the stress that just increased. Trauma functions just like stress but is much harder to recover.

During any scene in which your character is stressed out and has taken trauma, additional stress of that same type to your character goes directly to trauma of that type. This won’t happen often\! You’re already out of the scene, after all. But it might occur under some circumstances. Once trauma is stepped up beyond d12, your character is permanently out of options—they’re dead, hopelessly incoherent, lost to their own psyche, or whatever seems most appropriate.

If the next scene is one in which your PC can be taken care of or allowed to recuperate, your character’s stress is reduced to zero, but the trauma remains at the level it was at the end of the previous scene. Recovering trauma requires somebody else to make the tests to help you. This works like recovering stress but the effect die isn’t used, as follows:

- If the player beats the difficulty, the trauma is stepped down by one.
- If the player fails to beat the difficulty, the trauma does not get any better or worse. The player can’t try to recover that trauma again until time passes, although another friendly character might try to help.
- If the player rolls a hitch on a successful attempt to recover trauma, the Narrator may hand over a PP and inflict stress of a different type than the trauma that’s being recovered, starting at d6 (or stepping up by one if the PC already had stress of that type).
- If the player rolls a hitch on a failed attempt, the trauma gets worse, stepping up by one for each hitch rolled. If this steps the trauma up past d12, that’s all, folks.

# Technology in Bots and Botany

## Hub SystemOverview

The hub system represents the pinnacle of user interface technology in the Bots and Botany universe. Traditional hardware like laptops and keyboards have been rendered obsolete by the advent of nanite-based interaction. These nanites, dispersed through the water supply of habitable planets, interface directly with the user's brain, creating virtual displays and input methods that feel tangible.

## Nanites

Nanites act as the medium for the hub interface, translating neural signals into digital interactions and vice versa. Present in all sentient beings, these microscopic machines allow users to experience and interact with virtual environments seamlessly.

## Hardware and Software

The hub hardware consists of advanced computers that control and manage the nanites, facilitating the connection between the user's brain and the virtual interfaces. The software, akin to internet browsers, tailors user experiences with various features and customization options.

### Translation Software

One of the most notable examples of this is translation software. Translation software creates real-time subtitles, facilitating seamless communication across different languages and species, ensuring clear understanding and interaction among the galaxy's inhabitants. However, many species find that their sense of hearing, sight, or smell aren't broad or strong enough to comprehend all languages. Humans, for example, need to purchase permanent perks to enable them to see into infrared and ultraviolet if they want to communicate with the calxis; or to hear broadly enough to communicate with the amorfs; or to smell well enough to communicate more intimately with the flora and vearin.

## Cloud Computing and the Ether

Cloud infrastructure, facilitated by the galaxy-spanning internet known as the ether, allows for extensive data processing and storage, enhancing the hub's capabilities. This connectivity enables real-time interactions and access to remote services, expanding the hub's potential beyond the limitations of local hardware.

## Skill Pills and Perks

### Skill Pills

Skill Pills are advanced medical nanites that restructure the brain to teach new skills. They come in two varieties:

**Temporary Skill Pills:** Moderately priced, these provide skills for a limited duration.

**Permanent Skill Pills:** High-end pills that permanently impart skills, offering a long-term solution for skill acquisition.

### Perks

Perks are enhancements that alter the body to grant specific abilities or improvements. These modifications include things like enhanced senses, water breathing, and increased strength.

## Grav-DriveShip Propulsion

Grav-drives are revolutionary propulsion systems manipulating the Ether, a dimension where universal information is stored. They warp space-time locally, creating an artificial gravity. This enables vehicles to achieve rapid movement by constantly accelerating ("falling") in any direction specified by the grav-drive.

These drives are integral to both space travel and maintaining artificial gravity on ships and space stations.

On small devices, such as floating cameras, the grav-drives aren't housed locally on the device. This requires more compute power, but the result is that there is no size restriction on what a grav-drive can affect.

## E-GatesFaster-Than-Light Travel

E-Gates utilize ether manipulation to facilitate faster-than-light travel. By conflating space and information, these gates create pathways through the ether, optimizing travel times based on information density.

Gate Placement: E-Gates are strategically placed far from inhabited star systems to avoid interference.

Potential Risks: Navigating high-density information regions requires advanced systems and skilled pilots.

## Limited Intelligences (LIs)

LI's are programs designed by the machina to avoid attaining sentience, regulated to perform specific tasks. These intelligences play crucial roles in operating hub computers and other controlled environments, maintaining safety and predictability.

## Medical and Utility Nanites

Nanites are extensively used in medicine, performing tasks from targeting diseases to reviving the dead. Specialized medical nanites are programmed for temporary deployment within patients to ensure targeted treatment without long-term interference.

**Lazy-Tanks:** Devices used for bringing back the dead.

**Methusapods:** Devices reversing the aging process.

**Dilators:** Machines that manipulate time dilation, used for preserving food and inducing stasis for long space journeys.

## Weaponry and Defense

**Freezers:** Weapons that freeze targets to near absolute zero with a laser.

**Vibro-Weapons:** Tools that incapacitate targets instantly through vibrating pulses.

**Grav-Grenades:** Devices creating localized gravitational chaos.

**Pepper Shields:** Defenses that disperse kinetic energy from high-velocity projectiles, reviving close-quarters combat.

# Human Star Systems

Humans are a relatively new but influential species in the galaxy, inhabiting three main star systems, each governed by a different corporate entity. These systems reflect the diverse socio-political landscapes that have emerged from humanity's technological advancements and socio-economic shifts.

## Runex System

The Runex System is characterized by its governance under a hyper-intelligent supercomputer, resulting from the merger of two mega-corporations heavily invested in artificial intelligence. This merger occurred after the first collapse of human governments on Earth.

- **Governance**: The Runex System is controlled by a hyper-intelligent supercomputer, which ensures efficient and stable administration.
- **Societal Structure**: Society here is highly organized and technologically advanced, with significant reliance on AI for everyday activities.
- **Culture and Lifestyle**: Residents benefit from a well-ordered, efficient environment, but the pervasive presence of AI may lead to a lack of personal autonomy and spontaneity.

## Social System

The Social System represents a unique socio-economic experiment where governance operates on a freemium model. Chances are, if you see a human out and about, they came from the Social System.

- **Governance**: This system is the first freemium government, where citizenship tiers range from free (with extensive advertising) to various paid levels that offer more privileges and fewer ads.
- **Societal Structure**: Social stratification is pronounced, with citizens' quality of life directly correlated to their subscription level.
- **Culture and Lifestyle**: The constant presence of advertisements and the need to promote oneself can create a high-pressure environment. However, it also fosters a dynamic, media-savvy culture.

## Warbly-Carrot System

Following the collapse of Earth’s governments, the entertainment giant Warbly merged with the tech company Carrot, forming the Warbly-Carrot System. This system adopts a walled-garden approach to governance, focusing on contentment within its borders.

- **Governance**: Warbly-Carrot maintains a tightly controlled environment, prioritizing citizen happiness and minimizing exposure to external galactic events.
- **Societal Structure**: The population is kept content through a combination of entertainment and technological advances, but they remain largely ignorant of the broader galaxy.
- **Culture and Lifestyle**: The emphasis on entertainment creates a vibrant, albeit somewhat insular, culture where citizens are highly engaged in virtual and augmented realities.
